## Conveymanager


Certainly! Hereâ€™s a revised version of that paragraph:

This project is a showcase of a modern web application developed with Laravel 11 and Inertia.js + VueJS 3, highlighting key features and best practices. While it focuses on demonstrating fundamental concepts, it does not delve into more advanced techniques such as Domain-Driven Design (DDD), service and repository patterns, or event sourcing. For a more complex system that incorporates these advanced methodologies, you can explore the search engine I built from scratch on GitHub: [CrawlQuery](https://github.com/crawlquery/crawlquery).

Below, you'll find screenshots illustrating various features of this application, along with references to the related code files.
